## Conclusion & Perspectives

### Advancing Natural Products Knowledge

At its current development stage, data harmonized and curated throughout the LOTUS initiative remains imperfect and, by the very nature of research, at least partially biased (see [Introduction](#introduction)).
In the context of bioactive NP research, and due to global editorial practices, it should not be ignored that many publications tend to emphasize new compounds and/or those for which interesting bioactivity has been measured.
Near-ubiquitous (primarily plant-based) compounds, if broadly bioactive, tend to be overrepresented in the NP literature, yet the implication of their wide distribution in nature and associated patterns of non-specific activity are often underappreciated [@doi:10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01009]. 
Ideally, all characterized compounds independent of structural novelty and/or bioactivity profile should be documented, and the sharing of verified structure-organism pairs is fundamental to the advancement of NP research.

The LOTUS initiative provides a framework for rigorous review and incorporation of new records and already presents a valuable overview of the distribution of NP occurrences studied to date.
While current data presents a reasonable approximation of the chemistries of a few well-studied organisms such as *Arabidopsis thaliana*, it remains patchy for many other organisms represented in the dataset.
Community participation is the most efficient means of achieving a better documentation of NP occurrences, and the comprehensive editing opportunities provided within LOTUS and through the associated Wikidata distribution platform open new opportunities for such collaborative engagement.
In addition to facilitating the introduction of new data, it also provides a forum for critical review of existing data (see an example of a Wikidata Talk page [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Talk:Q104916955)), as well as harmonization and verification of existing NP datasets as they come online.

### Fostering FAIRness and TRUSTworthiness

The LOTUS harmonized data and dissemination of referenced structure-organism pairs through Wikidata, enables novel forms of queries and transformational perspectives in NP research.
As LOTUS follows the guidelines of FAIRness and TRUSTworthiness, all researchers across disciplines can benefit from this opportunity, whether the interest is in ecology and evolution, chemical ecology, drug discovery, biosynthesis pathway elucidation, chemotaxonomy, or other research fields connected with NP.

Researchers worldwide uniformly acknowledge the limitations caused by the intrinsic unavailability of essential (raw) data [@doi:10.1039/c6np00022c].
In addition to being FAIR, LOTUS data is also open with a clear license, while closed data is still a major impediment to advancement of science [@doi:10.1038/npre.2008.1526.1].
The lack of progress in such direction is partly due to elements in the dissemination channels of the classical print and static PDF publication formats that complicate or sometimes even discourage data sharing, e.g., due to page limitations and economically motivated mechanisms, including those involved in the focus on and calculation of journal impact factors.
In particular raw data such as experimental readings, spectroscopic data, instrumental measurements, statistical, and other calculations are valued by all, but disseminated by only very few.
The immense value of raw data and the desire to advance the public dissemination has recently been documented in detail for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic data by a large consortium of NP researchers [@doi:10.1039/c7np00064b].
However, to generate the vital flow of contributed data, the effort associated with preparing and submitting content to open repositories as well as data reuse should be better acknowledged in academia, government, regulatory, and industrial environments [@doi:10/gh533h; @doi:10/gfnxpj; @doi:10/gf3j9t]. The introduction of LOTUS provides here a new opportunity to advance the FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship [@doi:10/bdd4].

### Opening New Perspectives for Spectral Data

The possibilities for expansion and future applications of the Wikidata-based LOTUS initiative are significant.
For example, properly formatted spectral data (e.g. obtained by MS or NMR) can be linked to the Wikidata entries of the originating chemical compounds.
MassBank [@doi:10/d8pdcr] and SPLASH [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq476] identifiers are already reported in Wikidata, and this existing information can be used to report MassBank or SPLASH records for example for *Arabidopsis thaliana* compounds ([https://w.wiki/3PJD](https://w.wiki/3PJD)).
Such possibilities will help to bridge experimental data results obtained during the early stages of NP research with data that has been reported and formatted in different contexts.
This opens exciting perspectives for structural dereplication, NP annotation, and metabolomic analysis.
The authors have previously demonstrated that taxonomically-informed metabolite annotation is critical for the improvement of the NP annotation process [@doi:10/fm73].
Alternative approaches linking structural annotation to biological organisms have also shown substantial improvements [@doi:10.1101/2021.03.18.435634].
In this context, the LOTUS initiative offers new opportunities for linking chemical objects to both their biological occurrences and spectral information and should significantly facilitate such applications.

### Integrating Chemodiversity, Biodiversity, and Human Health {.page_break_before}

As shown in [SI-5](#si-5-complement-to-figure-7), observing the chemical and biological diversity at various granularities offers new insights.
Regarding the chemical objects involved, it will be important to document the taxonomies of chemical annotations for the Wikidata entries.
However, this is a rather complex task, for which stability and coverage issues will have to be addressed first.
Existing chemical taxonomies such as ChEBI, ClassyFire, or NPClassifier are evolving steadily, and it will be important to constantly update the tools used to make further annotations. [Promising efforts](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:SCIdude/Modeling#Chemical_ontology) have been undertaken to automate the inclusion of Wikidata structures into a chemical ontology. Such approach exploits the [SMILES](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q466769) and [SMARTS](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7544680) associated properties to infer a chemical classification for the structure. See for example the entry related to [emericellolide B](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q77573987).
Repositioning NP within their greater biosynthetic context is another major challenge - and active field of research.
The fact that the LOTUS initiative disseminates its data through Wikidata will help facilitate further integration with biological pathway knowledge bases such as [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways) and contribute to this complex task [@doi:10/gh6dq2; @doi:10.1093/nar/gkx1064].

In the field of ecology, molecular traits are gaining increased attention [@doi:10/gftqcm; @doi:10/ghttk6; @doi:10.1007/s10530-018-1735-y].
The LOTUS architecture can help to associate classical plant traits (e.g., leaf surface area, photosynthetic capacities, etc.) with Wikidata biological organisms entries, and, thus, allow their integration and comparison with chemicals that are associated with the organisms.
Likewise, the association of biogeography data documented in repositories such as GBIF could be further exploited in Wikidata to pursue the exciting but understudied topic of “chemodiversity hotspots” [@doi:10/ghssx4].

Other NP-related information of great interest remains poorly formatted.
One example of such a shortcoming relates to traditional medicine (and the field studying it: ethnomedicine and ethnobotany), which is the historical and empiric approach of mankind to discover and use bioactive products from Nature, primarily plants.
The amount of knowledge generated in human history on the use of medicinal substances represents a fascinating yet underutilized amount of information.
Notably, the body of literature on the pharmacology and toxicology of NP is compound-centric, increases steadily, and relatively scattered, but still highly relevant for exploring the role and potential utility of NP for human health.
To this end, the LOTUS initiative represents a potential framework for new concepts by which such information could be valued and conserved in the digital era [@doi:10/ggb79p; @doi:10/gh533j; @doi:10.1177/1934578X1701200849].
This underscores the transformative value of the LOTUS initiative for the advancement of traditional medicine and its interest for drug discovery in health systems worldwide.

### Shortcomings & Challenges

Despite these strong advantages, the establishment and functioning of the LOTUS curation pipeline is not devoid of defaults and we list hereafter some of the observed shortcomings and associated challenges.

First, the LOTUS processing pipeline is heavy.
It includes many dependencies and is convoluted.
We tried to simplify the process and associated programs as much as possible but they remain consequent.
This is the consequence of the heterogeneous nature of the source information and the number of successive operations required to process the data.

Second, while the overall objective of the LOTUS processing pipeline is to increase data quality, the pipeline also _transforms_ data during the process, and, in some cases, data quality can be degraded or errors can be propagated.
For example, regarding the chemical objects, the processing pipeline performs a systematic sanitization step that includes salt removal, uncharging of molecules and dimers resolving.
We decided to apply this step systematically after observing a high ratio of artifacts within salts, charged or dimeric molecules.
This thus implies that correct salts, charged or dimeric molecules in the input data will suffer an unwanted "sanitization" step.
Also, the LOTUS processing step uses external libraries and tools for the automated "name to structure" and "structure to name" translations. 
These remain challenging as they rely on sets of predefined rules which do not cover all cases and can commonly lead to incorrect translations.

On the biological organisms curation side, we are aware of shortcomings, whether inherent to specific inputs or regarding limitations of the general process.
Regarding inputs, some cases are clearly not resolvable except through human curation.
For example, the word Lotus can refer both to the genus of a plant of the Fabaceae family ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3645698](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3645698)) or to the vernacular name of _Nelumbo nucifera_ ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16528)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16528))).
In fact, the name of the LOTUS Initiative comes, in part, from this taxonomic curiosity - and the challenge for its automated curation.
To give another striking illustration, _Ficus variegata_ corresponds both to a plant ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5446649](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5446649)) and to a mollusc ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q502030](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q502030)).
For specific names coming from traditional Chinese medicine or other sources using vernacular names, translation was dependent on hand curated dictionaries, which are clearly not exhaustive.
Additionally, it is noteworthy to remind that the validation of the processed entries relies in part on partly imperfect rules, thus leading to erroneous entries in the output data. 
However, we also deliberately kept those rules restrictive in order to overall favor quality over quantity (see Figure @fig:alluvial).

Thus, despite our efforts, there is no doubt that incorrect structure-organism pairs have been uploaded on Wikidata (and some correct ones have not).  
We however expect that the editing facilities offered by this platform and community efforts will, over time, improve data quality.


### Summary & Outlook

Despite these challenges, the various facets discussed above connect with ongoing and future developments that the tandem of the LOTUS initiative and its Wikidata integration can accommodate through a broader knowledge base.
The information of the LOTUS initiative is already readily accessible by third party projects build on top of Wikidata such as the SLING project ([https://github.com/ringgaard/sling](https://github.com/ringgaard/sling), see entry for [gliotoxin](https://ringgaard.com/kb/Q413364)) or the Plant Humanities Lab project ([https://lab.plant-humanities.org](https://lab.plant-humanities.org), see entry for [*Ilex guayusa*](https://search.plant-humanities.org/?eid=wd%3AQ3772280) in the "From Related Items" section).
Ongoing discussions with the PubChem team should results in the addition of LOTUS data to complement the natural products related metadata of this major chemical DB.

Behind the scenes, all underlying resources represent data in a multidimensional space and can be extracted as individual graphs, which can then be interconnected.
The craft of appropriate federated queries allows users to navigate these graphs and fully exploit their potential [@doi:10/gdn52j; @doi:10/ggqqc6].
The development of interfaces such as RDFFrames [@wikidata:Q106204599] will also facilitate the use of the wide arsenal of existing machine learning approaches to automate reasoning on these knowledge graphs.

Overall, the LOTUS initiative aims to make more and better data available.
While we did our best to ensure high data quality, the current processing pipeline still removes a lot of correct entries and misses or induces some incorrect ones.
Aware of those imperfections, our project hopefully paves the way for the establishment of an open, durable and expandable electronic NP resource.
The design and efforts of the LOTUS initiative reflect our conviction that the integration of NP research results is long-needed and requires a truly open and FAIR approach to information dissemination, with high quality data directly flowing from its source to public knowledge bases.
We believe that the LOTUS initiative has the potential to fuel a virtuous cycle of research habits and, as a result, *contribute to a better understanding of Life and its chemistry*.
