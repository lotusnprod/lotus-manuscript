## Results & Discussion

This section is structured as follows: first, we present an [overview of the LOTUS initiative at its current stage of development](#blueprint-of-the-lotus-initiative).
The central [curation](#data-processing-&-validation) and [dissemination](#data-dissemination) elements of the LOTUS initiative are then explained in detail.
The [third section](#user-interaction-with-lotus-data) addresses the interaction modes between end-users and LOTUS, including _data retrieval_, _addition_ and _editing_.
Some examples on how LOTUS data can be used to answer research questions or develop hypothesis are given.
The [final section](#data-interpretation) is dedicated to the interpretation of LOTUS data and illustrates the dimensions and qualities of the current LOTUS dataset from chemical and biological perspectives.

### Blueprint of the LOTUS Initiative {.page_break_before}

Building on the standards established by the related WikiProjects on Wikidata ([Chemistry](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Chemistry), [Taxonomy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Taxonomy) and [Source Metadata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Source_MetaData)), a NP chemistry-oriented subproject was created ([Chemistry/Natural products](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Chemistry/Natural_products)).
Its central data consists of three minimal sufficient objects: 

- A *chemical structure object*, with associated Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) [@doi:10/fg6q5f], International Chemical Identifier (InChI) [@doi:10/6bg] and InChIKey (a hashed version of the InChI).
- A *biological organism object*, with associated taxon name, the taxonomic DB where it was described and the taxon ID in the respective DB.
- A *reference object* describing the structure-organism pair, with the associated article title and a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), a PubMed (PMID), or PubMed Central (PMCID) ID.

As data formats are largely inhomogeneous among existing electronic NP resources, fields related to chemical structure, biological organism and references are variable and essentially not standardized.
Therefore, LOTUS implements multiple stages of harmonization, processing and validation (Figure @fig:workflow, stages 1 to 3).
LOTUS employs a Single Source of Truth (SSOT, [Single_source_of_truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth)) to ensure data reliability and continuous availability of the latest curated version of LOTUS data in both Wikidata and LNPN (Figure @fig:workflow, stage 4).
The SSOT approach consists of a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) DB that structures links and data schemes such that every data element has a single place.
The LOTUS processing pipeline is tailored to efficiently include and diffuse novel or curated data directly from new sources or at the Wikidata level.
This iterative workflow relies both on data addition and retrieval actions as described in the [Data Interaction](#user-interaction-with-lotus-data) section.
The overall process leading to referenced and curated structure-organisms pairs is illustrated in Figure @fig:workflow and detailed below.

\

![**Blueprint of the LOTUS initiative.** Data undergo a four-stage process: (1) Harmonization, (2) Processing, (3) Validation and (4) Dissemination. The process was designed to incorporate future contributions (5), either by the addition of new data from within Wikidata (a) or new sources (b) or *via* curation of existing data (c). The figure is available under the CC0 license at [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_blueprint.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_blueprint.svg).](images/workflow.svg "Workflow"){#fig:workflow width="100%"}

By design, this iterative process fosters community participation, essential to efficiently document NP occurrences.
All stages of the workflow are described on the git sites of the LOTUS initiative at [https://github.com/lotusnprod](https://github.com/lotusnprod) and in the [methods](#Methods).
At the time of writing, 750,000+ LOTUS entries contained a curated chemical structure, biological organism and reference and were available on both Wikidata and LNPN.
As the LOTUS data volume is expected to increase over time, a frozen (as of 2021-12-20), tabular version of this dataset with its associated metadata is made available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794106](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794106) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5794106].

### Data Harmonization

Multiple data sources were processed as described hereafter.
All publicly accessible electronic NP resources included in [COCONUT](https://zenodo.org/record/3778405) that contain referenced structure-organism pairs were considered as initial input.
The data were complemented with COCONUT's own referenced structure-organism pairs [@doi:10/gh6dqw], as well as the following additional electronic NP resources: Dr. Duke [@DepartmentAgricultureAgricultural1992], Cyanometdb [@doi:10/gjgdzm], Datawarrior [@doi:10/f637rz], a subset of NAPRALERT, Wakankensaku [@MainPageWAKANKENSAKU] and DiaNat-DB [@doi:10.1039/D0RA10453A].

The contacts of the electronic NP resources not explicitly licensed as open were individually reached for permission to access and reuse data.
A detailed list of data sources and related information is available as [Appendix 1](#appendix-1-data-sources-list).
All necessary scripts for data gathering and harmonization can be found in the [lotus-processor](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor) repository in the [src/1_gathering](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/tree/main/src/1_gathering) directory and processed is detailed in the corresponding methods section [gathering section](#data-gathering).
All subsequent iterations including new data sources, either updated information from the same data sources or new data, will involve a comparison with the previously gathered data at the SSOT level to ensure that the data is only curated once.

### Data Processing & Validation

As shown in Figure @fig:workflow, data curation consisted of three stages: harmonization, processing and validation.
Thereby, after the harmonization stage, each of the three central objects - chemical compounds, biological organisms and reference - were processed, as described in related [methods section](#data-processing).
Given the data size (2.5M+ initial entries), manual validation was unfeasible.
Curating the references was a particularly challenging part of the process.
Whereas organisms are typically reported by at least their vernacular or scientific denomination and chemical structures via their SMILES, InChI, InChIKey or image (not covered in this work), references suffer from largely insufficient reporting standards.
Despite poor standardization of the initial reference field, proper referencing remains an indispensable way to establish the validity of structure-organism pairs.
Better reporting practices, supported by tools such as [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org) [@doi:10.5281/ZENODO.1036595; @doi:10.3897/rio.5.e35820] and relying on Wikidata, [Fatcat](https://fatcat.wiki), or [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org) should improve reference-related information retrieval in the future.

In addition to curating the entries during data processing, 420 referenced structure-organism pairs were selected for manual validation.
An entry was considered as valid if: *i)* the structure (in the form of any structural descriptor that could be linked to the final sanitized InChIKey) was described in the reference *ii)* the containing organism (as any organism descriptor that could be linked to the accepted canonical name) was described in the reference and *iii)* the reference was describing the occurrence of the chemical structure in the biological organism.
More details are available in the related [methods section](#data-validation).
This process allowed us to establish rules for automatic filtering and validation of the entries.
The parameters of the automatic filtering are available as a function ([filter_dirty.R](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/blob/main/src/r/filter_dirty.R)) and are further described in the related [methods section](#data-validation).
The automatic filtering was then applied to all entries.
To confirm the efficacy of the filtering process, a new subset of 100 diverse, automatically curated and automatically validated entries was manually checked, yielding a rate of 97% of true positives.
The detailed results of the two manual validation steps are reported in Supporting Information [Appendix 2](#appendix-2-summary-of-the-validation-statistics).
The resulting data is also available in the dataset shared at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794106](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794106) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5794106].
Table @tbl:examples shows an example of a referenced structure-organism pair before and after curation.
This process resolved the structure to an InChIKey, the organism to a valid taxonomic name and the reference to a DOI, thereby completing the establishment of the essential referenced structure-organism pair.
\

Table: Example of a referenced structure-organism pair before and after curation {#tbl:examples}

| | Structure | Organism | Reference | 
|:--------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Before curation** | Cyathocaline | Stem bark of Cyathocalyx zeylanica CHAMP. ex HOOK. f. & THOMS. (Annonaceae) | Wijeratne E. M. K., de Silva L. B., Kikuchi T., Tezuka Y., Gunatilaka A. A. L., Kingston D. G. I., J. Nat. Prod., 58, 459-462 (1995). | 
| **After curation** | VFIIVOHWCNHINZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N | Cyathocalyx zeylanicus | 10.1021/NP50117A020 | 

Challenging examples encountered during the development of the curation process were compiled in an edge cases table ([tests/tests.tsv](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/blob/main/tests/tests.tsv)) to allow for automated unit testing.
These tests allow a continuous revalidation of any change made to the code, ensuring that corrected errors will not reappear.
The alluvial plot in Figure @fig:alluvial illustrates the individual contribution of each *source* and *original* *subcategory* that led to the *processed* *categories*: structure, organism and reference.

\

![**Alluvial plot of the data transformation flow within LOTUS during the automated curation and validation processes.** The figure also reflects the relative proportions of the data stream in terms of the contributions from the various sources ("source" block, left), the composition of the harmonized subcategories ("original subcategory" block, middle) and the validated data after curation ("processed category" block, right). Automatically validated entries are represented in green, rejected entries in blue. The figure is available under the CC0 license at [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_alluvial_plot.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_alluvial_plot.svg).](images/alluvial.svg "Alluvial"){#fig:alluvial width="100%"}

The figure highlights, for example, the essential contribution of the reference DOI category to the final validated entries.
A similar pattern can be seen concerning structures, where the validation rate of structural identifiers is higher than chemical names.
The combination of the results of the automated curation pipeline and the manually curated entries led to the establishment of four categories (manually validated, manually rejected, automatically validated and automatically rejected) of the referenced structure-organism pairs that formed the processed part of the SSOT.
Out of a total of 2.5M+ initial pairs, the manual and automatic validation retained 750,000+ pairs (approximately 30%), which were then selected for dissemination on Wikidata.
Among validated entries, multiple ones were redundant among the source databases, thus also explaining the decrease of entries between the initial pairs and validated ones.
Moreover, because data quality was favored over quantity, the number of rejected entries is high.
Among them, multiple correct entries were certainly falsely rejected, but still not disseminated.
All rejected entries were kept aside for later manual inspection and validation.
These are publicly available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794597](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794597) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5794597].
In the end, the disseminated data contained 290,000+ unique chemical structures, 40,000+ distinct organisms and 75,000+ references.

### Data Dissemination

Research worldwide can benefit the most when all results of published scientific studies are fully accessible immediately upon publication [@doi:10.1038/417222b].
This concept is considered the foundation of scientific investigation and a prerequisite for the effective direction of new research efforts based on prior information.
To achieve this, research results have to be made publicly available and reusable.
As computers are now the main investigation tool for a growing number of scientists, all research data including those in publications should be disseminated in computer-readable format, following the FAIR principles.
LOTUS uses Wikidata as a repository for referenced structure-organism pairs, as this allows documented research data to be integrated with a large, pre-existing and extensible body of chemical and biological knowledge.
The dynamic nature of Wikidata encourages the continuous curation of deposited data through the user community.
Independence from individual and institutional funding represents another major advantage of Wikidata.
The Wikidata knowledge base and the option to use elaborate SPARQL queries allow the exploration of the dataset from a sheer unlimited number of angles.
The openness of Wikidata also offers unprecedented opportunities for community curation, which will support, if not guarantee, a dynamic and evolving data repository.
At the same time, certain limitations of this approach can be anticipated.
Despite (or possibly due to) their power, SPARQL queries can be complex and potentially require an in-depth understanding of the models and data structure.
This involves a steep learning curve which can discourage some end-users.
Furthermore, traditional ways to query electronic NP resources such as structural or spectral searches are currently not within the scope of Wikidata and, are thus addressed in LNPN.
Using the pre-existing COCONUT template, LNPN hosting allows the user to perform structural searches by directly drawing a molecule, thereby addressing the current lack of such structural search possibilities in Wikidata.
Since metabolite profiling by Liquid Chromatography (LC) - Mass Spectrometry (MS) is now routinely used for the chemical composition assessment of natural extracts, future versions of LOTUS and COCONUT are envisioned to be augmented by predicted MS spectra and hosted at [https://naturalproducts.net](https://naturalproducts.net) to allow mass and spectral-based queries.
Note that such spectral database is already available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5607264](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5607264) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5607264].
To facilitate queries focused on specific taxa (e.g., "return all molecules found in the Asteraceae family"), a unified taxonomy is paramount.
As the taxonomy of living organisms is a complex and constantly evolving field, all the taxon identifiers from all accepted taxonomic DB for a given taxon name were kept.
Initiatives such as the [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org) (OTL) [@doi:10/ggkjbt] will help to gradually reduce these discrepancies, and the Wikidata platform can and does support such developments.
OTL also benefits from regular expert curation and new data.
As the taxonomic identifier property for this resource did not exist in Wikidata, its creation was requested and obtained.
The property is now available as "Open Tree of Life ID" ([P9157](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9157)).

Following the previously described curation process, all validated entries have been made available through Wikidata and LNPN.
LNPN will be regularly mirroring Wikidata LOTUS through the SSOT as described in Figure @fig:workflow.

### User Interaction with LOTUS Data

The possibilities to interact with the LOTUS data are numerous.
The following gives examples of how to retrieve, add and edit LOTUS data.

#### Data Retrieval

LOTUS data can be queried and retrieved either directly in Wikidata or on LNPN, both of which have distinct advantages.
While Wikidata offers flexible and powerful queries capacities at the cost of potential complexity, LNPN has a graphical user interface with capabilities of drawing chemical structures, simplified structural or biological filtering and advanced chemical descriptors, albeit with a more rigid structure.
For bulk download, a frozen version of LOTUS data (timestamp of 2021-12-20) is also available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794106](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794106) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5794106].
More refined approaches to the direct interrogation of the up-to-date LOTUS data both in Wikidata and LNPN are detailed hereafter.

##### Wikidata

The easiest way to search for NP occurrence information in Wikidata is by typing the name of a chemical structure directly into the "Search Wikidata" field, which (for left-to-right languages) can be found in the upper right corner of the [Wikidata homepage](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) or any other Wikidata page.
For example, by typing "erysodine", the user will land on the page of this compound ([Q27265641](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27265641)).
Scrolling down to the "found in taxon" statement will allow the user to view the biological organisms reported to contain this NP (Figure @fig:wdpage).
Clicking the reference link under each taxon name links to the publication(s) documenting the occurrence.

![**Illustration of the "found in taxon" statement section on the Wikidata page** of erysodine [Q27265641](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27265641) showing a selection of erysodine-containing taxa and the references documenting these occurrences.](images/erysodine.svg "wdpage"){#fig:wdpage width="100%"}

The typical approach to more elaborated querying involves writing SPARQL queries using the [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org) or another direct connection to a SPARQL endpoint.
Below are some examples from simple to more elaborated queries, demonstrating what can be done using this approach.
The full-text queries with explanations are included in [Appendix 3](#appendix-3-wikidata-queries).

Table: Potential questions about structure-organism relationships and corresponding Wikidata queries. {#tbl:queries}

| Question | Wikidata SPARQL query | 
|:------------------------:|:-------------:|
| What are the compounds present in Mouse-ear cress (*Arabidopsis thaliana*) or its child taxa? | [https://w.wiki/4Vcv](https://w.wiki/4Vcv) | 
| Which organisms are known to contain *β*-sitosterol? | [https://w.wiki/4VFn](https://w.wiki/4VFn) | 
| Which organisms are known to contain stereoisomers of *β*-sitosterol?| [https://w.wiki/4VFq](https://w.wiki/4VFq) | 
| Which pigments are found in which taxa, according to which reference? | [https://w.wiki/4VFx](https://w.wiki/4VFx) |
| What are examples of organisms where compounds were found in an organism sharing the same parent taxon, but not in the organism itself? | [https://w.wiki/4Wt3](https://w.wiki/4Wt3) |
| Which *Zephyranthes* species lack compounds known from at least two species in the genus? | [https://w.wiki/4VG3](https://w.wiki/4VG3) |
| How many compounds are structurally similar to compounds labeled as antibiotics? (grouped by the parent taxon of the containing organism) | [https://w.wiki/4VG4](https://w.wiki/4VG4) |
| Which organisms contain indolic scaffolds? Count occurrences, group and order the results by the parent taxon. | [https://w.wiki/4VG9](https://w.wiki/4VG9) |
| Which compounds with known bioactivities were isolated from Actinobacteria, between 2014 and 2019, with related organisms and references? | [https://w.wiki/4VGC](https://w.wiki/4VGC) |
| Which compounds labeled as terpenoids were found in *Aspergillus* species, between 2010 and 2020, with related references? | [https://w.wiki/4VGD](https://w.wiki/4VGD) |
| Which are the available referenced structure-organism pairs on wikidata? (example limited to 1000 results) | [https://w.wiki/4VFh](https://w.wiki/4VFh) |

The queries presented in Table @tbl:queries are only selected examples, and many other ways of interrogating LOTUS can be formulated.
Generic queries can be used, for example, for hypothesis generation when starting a research project.
For instance, a generic SPARQL query - listed in Table @tbl:queries as "Which are the available referenced structure-organism pairs on wikidata?" - retrieves all structures, identified by their InChIKey ([P235](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P235)), which contain "found in taxon" ([P703](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P703)) statements that are stated in ([P248](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P248)) a bibliographic reference: [https://w.wiki/4VFh](https://w.wiki/4VFh).
Data can then be exported in various formats, such as classical tabular formats, json, or html tables (see Download tab on the lower right of the query frame).
At the time of writing (2021-12-20), this query (without the LIMIT 1000) returned 951,800 entries; a frozen query result is available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5668854](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5668854) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5668854].

Targeted queries allowing to interrogate LOTUS data from the perspective of one of the three objects forming the referenced structure-organism pairs can also be built.
Users can, for example, retrieve a list of all structures reported from a given organism, such as all structures reported from *Arabidopsis thaliana* ([Q158695](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q158695)) or its child taxa ([https://w.wiki/4Vcv](https://w.wiki/4Vcv)).
Alternatively, all organisms containing a given chemical can be queried via its structure, such as in the search for all organisms where *β*-sitosterol ([Q121802](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q121802)) was found in ([https://w.wiki/4VFn](https://w.wiki/4VFn)).
For programmatic access, the [lotus-wikidata-exporter](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-wikidata-exporter) repository also allows data retrieval in RDF format and as TSV tables.

To further showcase the possibilities, two additional queries were established ([https://w.wiki/4VGC](https://w.wiki/4VGC) and [https://w.wiki/4VGD](https://w.wiki/4VGD)).
Both queries were inspired by recent literature review works [@doi:10.1016/j.micres.2021.126708; @doi:10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.113011].
The first work describes compounds found in Actinobacteria, with a biological focus on compounds with reported bioactivity.
The second one describes compounds found in *Aspergillus* spp., with a chemical focus on terpenoids.
In both cases, in seconds, the queries allow retrieving a table similar to the ones in the mentioned literature reviews.
While these queries are not a direct substitute for manual literature review, they do allow researchers to quickly begin such a review process with a very strong body of relevant references.

For a convenient expansion or limitation of the results, certain types of queries such as structure or similarity searches usually exist in molecular electronic resources.
As these queries are not natively integrated by SPARQL, they are not readily available for Wikidata exploration.
To address such limitation, Galgonek et al. developed an in-house SPARQL engine that allows utilization of Sachem, a high-performance chemical DB cartridge for PostgreSQL for fingerprint-guided substructure and similarity search [@doi:10/gdn52j].
The engine is used by the Integrated Database of Small Molecules (IDSM) that operates, among other things, several dedicated endpoints allowing structural search in selected small-molecule datasets via SPARQL [@doi:10/gf5bv5].
To allow substructure and similarity searches via SPARQL also on compounds from Wikidata, a [dedicated IDSM/Sachem endpoint](https://idsm.elixir-czech.cz/sparql/endpoint/wikidata) was created for the LOTUS project.
The endpoint indexes isomeric ([P2017](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2017)) and canonical ([P233](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P233)) SMILES code available in Wikidata.
To ensure that data is kept up-to-date, SMILES codes are automatically downloaded from Wikidata daily.
The endpoint allows users to run [federated queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query) and, thereby, proceed to structure-oriented searches on the LOTUS data hosted at Wikidata.
For example, the SPARQL query [https://w.wiki/4VG9](https://w.wiki/4VG9) returns a list of all organisms that produce NP with an indolic scaffold.
The output is aggregated at the parent taxa level of the containing organisms and ranked by the number of scaffold occurrences.

Regarding the versioning aspects, some challenges are implied by the dynamic nature of the Wikidata environment.
However, tracking of the data evolution can be achieved in multiple ways and at different levels: at the full Wikidata level, dumps are regularly created ([https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities)) while at the individual entry level the full history of modification can be consulted (see following link for the full edit history of erythromycin for example ([https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q213511&action=history](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q213511&action=history))).

We propose to the users a simple approach to document, version and share the output of queries on the LOTUS data at a defined time point.
For this, in addition to sharing the short url of a the SPARQL query (which will return results evolving over time), a simple archiving of the returned table to Zenodo or similar platform can be done.
In order to gather results of SPARQL queries we established [the LOTUS Initiative Community repository](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-lotus-initiative/).
The following link allows to directly contribute to the community repository [https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=the-lotus-initiative](https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=the-lotus-initiative).
For example the output of this Wikidata SPARQL query [https://w.wiki/4N8G](https://w.wiki/4N8G) realized on the 2021-11-10T16:56 can be easily archived and shared in a publication via its DOI [10.5281/zenodo.5668380](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5668380).

##### Lotus.NaturalProducts.Net (LNPN)

In the search field of the LNPN interface ([https://lotus.naturalproducts.net](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net)), simple queries can be achieved by typing the molecule name (e.g., [ibogaine](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/search/simple/ibogaine)) or pasting a SMILES, InChI, InChIKey string, or a Wikidata identifier.
All compounds reported from a given organism can be found by entering the organism name at the species or any higher taxa level (e.g. [*Tabernanthe iboga*](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/search/simple/Tabernanthe%20iboga)).
Compound search by chemical class is also possible.

Alternatively, a structure can be directly drawn in the structure search interface ([https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/search/structure](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/search/structure)), where the user can also decide on the nature of the structure search (exact, similarity, substructure search).
Refined search mode combining multiple search criteria, in particular physicochemical properties, is available in the advanced search interface ([https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/search/advanced](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/search/advanced)).

Within LNPN, LOTUS bulk data can be retrieved as SDF or SMILES files, or as a complete MongoDB dump via [https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/download](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/download).
Extensive documentation describing the search possibilities and data entries is available at [https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/documentation](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/documentation).
LNPN can also be queried via the application programming interface (API) as described in the documentation.

#### Data Addition and Evolution {.page_break_before}

One major advantage of the LOTUS architecture is that every user has the option to contribute to the NP occurrences documentation effort by adding new or editing existing data.
As all LOTUS data applies the SSOT mechanism, reprocessing of previously treated elements is avoided.
However, at the moment, the SSOT channels are not open to the public for direct write access to maintain data coherence and evolution of the SSOT scheme.
For now, the users can employ the following approaches to add or modify data in LOTUS.

##### Sources

LOTUS data management involves regular re-importing of both current and new data sources.
New and edited information from these electronic NP resources will be checked against the SSOT.
If absent or different, data will be passed through the curation pipeline and subsequently stored in the SSOT.
Accordingly, by contributing to external electronic NP resources, any researcher has a means of providing new data for LOTUS, keeping in mind the inevitable delay between data addition and subsequent inclusion into LOTUS.

##### Wikidata

The currently favored approach to add new data to LOTUS is to create or edit Wikidata entries directly.
Newly created or edited data will then be imported into the SSOT.
There are several ways to interact with Wikidata which depend on the technical skills of the user and the volume of data to be uploaded/modified.

###### Pre-requisites

While direct Wikidata upload is possible, contributors are encouraged to use the LOTUS curation pipeline as a preliminary step to strengthen the initial data quality.
For this, a specific mode of the LOTUS processor can be called (see [Custom mode](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/wiki/Make-commands#custom)).
The added data will therefore benefit from the curation and validation stages implemented in the LOTUS processing pipeline.

###### Manual Upload

Any researcher interested in reporting NP occurrences can manually add the data directly in Wikidata, without any particular technical knowledge requirement.
For this the creation of a Wikidata account and following the [general object editing guidelines](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tours) is advised.
Regarding the addition of NP-centered objects (i.e., referenced structure-organisms pairs), users shall refer to the [WikiProject Chemistry/Natural products](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Chemistry/Natural_products) group page.

A tutorial for the manual creation and upload of a referenced structure-organism pair to Wikidata is available in [Appendix 4](#appendix-4-wikidata-entry-creation-tutorial).


###### Batch and Automated Upload

Through the initial curation process described previously, 750,000+ referenced structure-organism pairs were validated for Wikidata upload.
To automate this process, a set of programs were written to automatically process the curated outputs, group references, organisms and compounds, check if they are already present in Wikidata (using SPARQL and direct Wikidata querying) and insert or update the entities as needed (i.e., upserting).
These scripts can be used for future batch upload of properly curated and referenced structure-organism pairs to Wikidata.
Programs for data addition to Wikidata can be found in the repository [lotus-wikidata-interact](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-wikidata-interact).
The following [Xtools page](https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/www.wikidata.org/NPImporterBot) offers an overview of the latest activity performed by our [NPimporterBot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:NPImporterBothttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:NPImporterBot), using those programs.

#### Data Editing {.page_break_before}

Even if correct at a given time point, scientific advances can invalidate or update previously uploaded data.
Thus, the possibility to continuously edit the data is desirable and guarantees data quality and sustainability.
Community-maintained knowledge bases such as Wikidata encourage such a process.
Wikidata presents the advantage of allowing both manual and automated correction.
Field-specific robots such as [SuccuBot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:SuccuBot), [KrBot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:KrBot), [Pi_bot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Pi_bot) and [ProteinBoxBot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:ProteinBoxBot) or our [NPimporterBot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:NPImporterBot) went through an approval process.
The robots are capable of performing thousands of edits without the need for human input.
This automation helps reduce the amount of incorrect data that would otherwise require manual editing.
However, manual curation by human experts remains irreplaceable as a standard.
Users who value this approach and are interested in contributing are invited to follow the manual curation tutorial in [Appendix 4](#appendix-4-wikidata-entry-creation-tutorial).

The [Scholia platform](https://scholia.toolforge.org) provides a visual interface to display the links among Wikidata objects such as researchers, topics, species or chemicals.
It now provides an interesting way to view the chemical compounds found in a given biological organism (see here for the metabolome view of [*Eurycoma longifolia*](https://scholia.toolforge.org/taxon/Q311710)).
If Scholia currently does not offer a direct editing interface for scientific references, it still allows users to proceed to convenient batch editing via [Quick Statements](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:QuickStatements).
The adaptation of such a framework to edit the referenced structure-pairs in the LOTUS initiative could thus facilitate the capture of future expert curation, especially manual efforts that cannot be replaced by automated scripts.

### Data Interpretation

To illustrate the nature and dimensions of the LOTUS dataset, some selected examples of data interpretation are shown.
First, the distribution of chemical structures among four important NP reservoirs: plants, fungi, animals and bacteria (Table @tbl:distribution).
Then, the distribution of biological organisms according to the number of related chemical structures and likewise the distribution of chemical structures across biological organisms are illustrated (Figure @fig:distribution).
Furthermore, the individual electronic NP resources participation in LOTUS data is resumed using the UpSet plot depiction, which allows the visualization of intersections in data sets (Figure @fig:upset).
Across these figures we take again the two previous examples, i.e, *β*-sitosterol as chemical structure and *Arabidopsis thaliana* as biological organism because of their well-documented statuses.
Finally, a biologically-interpreted chemical tree and a chemically-interpreted biological tree are presented (Figure @fig:tmap and Figure @fig:magicTree).
The examples illustrate the overall chemical and biological coverage of LOTUS by linking family-specific classes of chemical structures to their taxonomic position.
Table @tbl:distribution, Figures @fig:distribution, @fig:tmap and @fig:magicTree were generated using the frozen data (2021-12-20 timestamp), which is available for download at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794106](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5794106) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5794106].
Figure @fig:upset required a dataset containing information from closed resources and the complete data used for its generation is therefore not available for public distribution.
All scripts used for the generation of the figures are available in the [lotus-processor](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor) repository in the [src/4_visualizing](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/tree/main/src/4_visualizing) directory for reproducibility.

#### Distribution of Chemical Structures across reported Biological Organisms in LOTUS

Table @tbl:distribution summarizes the distribution of chemical structures and their chemical classes (according to NPClassifier [@doi:10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00399]) across the biological organisms reported in LOTUS.
For this, biological organisms were grouped into four artificial taxonomic levels (plants, fungi, animals and bacteria).
These were built by combining the two highest taxonomic levels in the OTL taxonomy, namely Domain and Kingdom levels.
"Plants" corresponded to "Eukaryota_Archaeplastida", "Fungi" to "Eukaryota_Fungi", "Animals" to "Eukaryota_Metazoa" and "Bacteria" to "Bacteria_NA".
The category corresponding to "Eukaryota_NA" mainly contained Algae, but also other organisms such as Amoebozoa and was therefore excluded.
This represented less than 1% of all entries.
The details of this process are available under [src/3_analyzing/structure_taxon_distribution.R](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/blob/main/src/3_analyzing/structure_taxon_distribution.R).
When the chemical structure/class was reported only in one taxonomic grouping, it was counted as "specific".

Table: Distribution and specificity of chemical structures across four important NP reservoirs: plants, fungi, animals and bacteria. When the chemical structure/class appeared only in one group and not the three others, they were counted as "specific". Chemical classes were attributed with NPClassifier. {#tbl:distribution}

| **Group** | **Organisms** | **Structure-Organism Pairs** | **Chemical Structures** | **Specific Chemical Structures** | **Chemical Classes** | **Specific Chemical Classes** | 
|:-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| **Plantae** | 28,439 | 567,647 | 201,073 | 194,425 (97%) | 545 | 59 (11%) |
| **Fungi** | 4,003 | 62,505 | 42,387 | 38,861 (92%) | 417 | 19 (5%) |
| **Animalia** | 2,716 | 40,321 | 28,237 | 23,569 (83%) | 456 | 14 (3%) |
| **Bacteria** | 1,555 | 35,644 | 27,415 | 25,208 (92%) | 385 | 42 (11%) |

#### Distributions of Organisms per Structure and Structures per Organism 

Readily achievable outcomes from LOTUS show that the depth of exploration of the world of NP is rather limited: as depicted in Figure @fig:distribution, on average, three organisms are reported per chemical structure and eleven structures per organism.
Notably, half of all structures have been reported from a single organism and half of all studied organisms are reported to contain five or fewer structures.
Metabolomics studies suggest that these numbers are heavily underrated [@doi:10/b3z2g7; @doi:10/ggwr93] and indicate that a better reporting of the metabolites detected in the course of NP chemistry investigations should greatly improve coverage. 

This incomplete coverage may be partially explained by the habit in classical NP journals to accept only new and/or bioactive chemical structures for publication. Another possible explanation is the fact that specific chemical classes have been under heavier scrutiny by the natural products community than others. For example, alkaloids have two specific characteristics which favors their reporting in the literature. First, their are often endowed with potent biological activities making them a target in the frame of pharmacognosy research. Second, their chemical nature makes them readily accessible from complex biological matrices through acido-basic extraction. It is thus a complex task to answer the following question: "Is the currently observed repartition of alkaloids across the tree of life a reflection of their true biological occurrence or is this repartition biased by the aforementioned characteristics of this chemical class ?" Both is an easy, and most likely correct, answer. However the challenge lies in disentangling the bias form the true occurrence. This complex challenge is an open one for which we have no definitive answers. The LOTUS initiative should however offer sound and strong foundations for such research problematic.

Another obvious explanation to the limited coverage is the fact that most of the chemical structures in LOTUS have been physically isolated and described. This is an extremely time consuming effort which can obviously not be carried on all metabolites of all biological organisms. Here, the sensitivity of mass spectrometry and the ever-increasing efficiency of computational metabolite annotation solution could offer a strong take. The documentation of metabolite annotation results obtained on large collections of biological matrices and the associated metadata within knowledge graphs offers exciting perspectives regarding the possibilities to expand both the chemical and biological coverage of the LOTUS data in a feasible manner.

#### Contribution of Individual Electronic NP Resources to LOTUS {.page_break_before}

The added value of the LOTUS initiative to assemble multiple electronic NP resources is illustrated in Figure @fig:upset : Panel A shows the contributions of the individual electronic NP resources to the ensemble of chemical structures found in one of the most studied vascular plants, *Arabidopsis thaliana* ("Mouse-ear cress"; [Q147096](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q147096)).
Panel B shows the ensemble of taxa reported to contain the planar structure of the widely occurring triterpenoid *β*-sitosterol ([Q121802](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q121802)).

![**UpSet plots of the individual contribution of electronic NP resources** to the planar structures found in *Arabidopsis thaliana* (A) and to organisms reported to contain the planar structure of *β*-sitosterol (KZJWDPNRJALLNS) (B). UpSet plots are evolved Venn diagrams, allowing to represent intersections between multiple sets. The horizontal bars on the lower left represent the number of corresponding entries per electronic NP resource. The dots and their connecting line represent the intersection between source and consolidate sets. The vertical bars indicate the number of entries at the intersection. For example, 479 organisms containing the planar structure of *β*-sitosterol are present in both UNPD and NAPRALERT, whereas each of them respectively reports 1,349 and 2,330 organisms containing the planar structure of *β*-sitosterol. The figure is available under the CC0 license at [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_upset_plot.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_upset_plot.svg).](images/upset_combined.svg "upset"){#fig:upset width="100%"}

Figure @fig:upset A. also shows that according to NPClassifier, the "chemical pathway" category distribution across electronic NP resources is not conserved.
Note that NPClassifier and ClassyFire [@doi:10/gc5tqv] chemical classification results are both available as metadata in the frozen LOTUS export and LNPN.
Both classification tools return a chemical taxonomy for individual structures, thus allowing their grouping at higher hierarchical levels, in the same way as it is done for biological taxonomies.
The UpSet plot in Figure @fig:upset indicates the poor overlap of preexisting electronic NP resources and the added value of an aggregated dataset.
This is particularly well illustrated in Figure @fig:upset B., where the number of organisms for which the planar structure of *β*-sitosterol (KZJWDPNRJALLNS) has been reported is shown for each intersection.
NAPRALERT has by far the highest number of entries (2,330 in total), while other electronic NP resources complement this well: e.g., UNPD has 573 reported organisms with *β*-sitosterol that do not overlap with any other resource.
Of note, *β*-sitosterol is documented in only 13 organisms in the DNP, highlighting the importance of a better systematic reporting of ubiquitous metabolites and the interest of multiple data sources agglomeration.

#### A Biologically-interpreted Chemical Tree

The chemical diversity captured in LOTUS is here displayed using TMAP (Figure @fig:tmap), a visualization library allowing the structural organization of large chemical datasets as a minimum spanning tree [@doi:10/gjjz4f].
Using Faerun, an interactive HTML file is generated to display metadata and molecule structures by embedding the SmilesDrawer library [@doi:10/gcmhc5; @doi:10/gjjz4d].
Planar structures were used for all compounds to generate the TMAP (chemical space tree-map) using MAP4 encoding [@doi:10/gjjz4c].
As the tree organizes structures according to their molecular fingerprint, an anticipated coherence between the clustering of compounds and the mapped NPClassifier chemical class is observed (Figure @fig:tmap A.).
For clarity, some of the most represented chemical classes of LOTUS plus quassinoids and stigmastane steroids are mapped, with examples of a quassinoid (NXZXPYYKGQCDRO) (light green star) and a stigmastane steroid (KZJWDPNRJALLNS) (dark green diamond) and their corresponding location in the TMAP.

![**TMAP visualizations of the chemical diversity present in LOTUS.** Each dot corresponds to a chemical structure. A highly specific quassinoid (NXZXPYYKGQCDRO) (light green star) and an ubiquitous stigmastane steroid (KZJWDPNRJALLNS) (dark green diamond) are mapped as examples in all visualizations. In panel A., compounds (dots) are colored according to the NPClassifier chemical class they belong to. In panel B., compounds that are mostly reported in the Simaroubaceae family are highlighted in blue. Finally, in panel C., the compounds are colored according to the specificity score of chemical classes found in biological organisms. This biological specificity score at a given taxonomic level for a given chemical class is calculated as a [Jensen-Shannon divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence). A score of 1 suggests that compounds are highly specific, 0 that they are ubiquitous. Zooms on a group of compounds of high biological specificity score (in pink) and on compounds of low specificity (blue) are depicted. An interactive HTML visualization of the LOTUS TMAP is available at [https://lotus.nprod.net/post/lotus-tmap/](https://lotus.nprod.net/post/lotus-tmap/) and archived at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5801807](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5801807) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5801807]. The figure is available under the CC0 license at [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_biologically_interpreted_chemical_tree.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_biologically_interpreted_chemical_tree.svg).](images/tmap.svg "tmap"){#fig:tmap width="100%"}

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

To explore relationships between chemistry and biology, it is possible to map taxonomical information such as the most reported biological family per chemical compound (Figure @fig:tmap B.) or the biological specificity of chemical classes (Figure @fig:tmap C.) on the TMAP.
The biological specificity score at a given taxonomic level for a given chemical class is calculated as a [Jensen-Shannon divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence).
A score of 1 suggests that compounds are highly specific, 0 that they are ubiquitous.
For more details, see [3_analyzing/jensen_shannon_divergence.R](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/blob/main/src/3_analyzing/jensen_shannon_divergence.R).
This visualization allows to highlight chemical classes specific to a given taxon, such as the quassinoids in the Simaroubaceae family.
In this case it is striking to see how well the compounds of a given chemical class (quassinoids) (Figure @fig:tmap A.) and the most reported plant family per compound (Simaroubaceae) (Figure @fig:tmap B.) overlap.
This is also evidenced on Figure @fig:tmap C. with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.99 at the biological family level for quassinoids.
In this plot, it is also possible to identify chemical classes that are widely spread among living organisms, such as the stigmastane steroids, which exhibit a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.73 at the biological family level.
This means that repartition of stigmastane steroids among families is not specific.
Figure @fig:magicTree-additional further supports this statement.

#### A Chemically-interpreted Biological Tree

An alternative view of the biological and chemical diversity covered by LOTUS is illustrated in Figure @fig:magicTree.
Here, chemical compounds are not organized but biological organisms are placed in their taxonomy.
To limit bias due to under-reporting in the literature and keep a reasonable display size, only families with at least 50 reported compounds were included.
Organisms were classified according to the OTL taxonomy and structures according to NPClassifier.
The tips were labeled according to the biological family and colored according to their biological kingdom.
The bars represent structure specificity of the most characteristic chemical class of the given biological family (the higher the more specific).
This specificity score was a [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) between the chemical class and the biological family.
For more details, see [4_visualizing/plot_magicTree.R](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/blob/main/src/4_visualizing/plot_magicTree.R).

![**LOTUS provides new means of exploring and representing chemical and biological diversity.** The tree generated from current LOTUS data builds on biological taxonomy and employs the kingdom as tips label color (only families containing 50+ chemical structures were considered). The outer bars correspond to the most specific chemical class found in the biological family. The height of the bar is proportional to a specificity score corresponding to a [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) between the chemical class and the biological family. The bar color corresponds to the chemical pathway of the most specific chemical class in the NPClassifier classification system. The size of the leaf nodes corresponds to the number of genera reported in the family. The figure is vectorized and zoomable for detailed inspection and is available under the CC0 license at [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_chemically_interpreted_biological_tree.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_chemically_interpreted_biological_tree.svg).](images/magicTree.svg "magicTree"){#fig:magicTree width="100%"}

![Distribution of *β*-sitosterol and related chemical parents among families with at least 50 reported compounds present in LOTUS. Script used for the generation of each tree in the figure is the same ([src/4_visualizing/plot_magicTree.R](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/blob/main/src/4_visualizing/plot_magicTree.R)) as for Figure @fig:magicTree as both figures are related. The figure is available under CC0 license at [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_chemically_interpreted_biological_tree_supplement.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lotus_initiative_1_chemically_interpreted_biological_tree_supplement.svg).](images/magicTree_additional.svg "magicTree_additional"){#fig:magicTree-additional tag="7-figure supplement 1"}

Figure @fig:magicTree makes it possible to spot highly specific compound classes such as trinervitane terpenoids in the Termitidae, the rhizoxin macrolides in the Rhizopodaceae, or the quassinoids and limonoids typical, respectively, of Simaroubaceae and Meliaceae.
Similarly, tendencies of more generic occurrence of NP can be observed.
For example, within the fungal kingdom, Basidiomycotina appear to have a higher biosynthetic specificity toward terpenoids than other fungi, which mostly focus on polyketides production.
As explained previously, Figure @fig:magicTree is highly dependent of the data reported in literature.
As also illustrated in Figure @fig:distribution, some compounds can be over-studied among several organisms, and many organisms studied for specific compounds only.
This is a direct consequence of the way the NP community reports its data actually.
Having this in mind, when observed at a finer scale, down to the structure level, such chemotaxonomic representation can give valuable insights.
For example, among all chemical structures, only two were found in all biological kingdoms, namely heptadecanoic acid (KEMQGTRYUADPNZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N) and *β*-carotene (OENHQHLEOONYIE-JLTXGRSLSA-N).
Looking at the distribution of *β*-sitosterol (KZJWDPNRJALLNS-VJSFXXLFSA-N) within the overall biological tree, Figure @fig:magicTree-additional plots its presence/absence *versus* those of its superior chemical classifications, namely the stigmastane, steroid and terpenoid derivatives, over the same tree used in Figure @fig:magicTree.
The comparison of these five chemically-interpreted biological trees clearly highlights the increasing speciation of the *β*-sitosterol biosynthetic pathway in the Archaeplastida kingdom, while the superior classes are distributed across all kingdoms.
Figure @fig:magicTree is zoomable and vectorized for detailed inspection.

As illustrated, the possibility of data interrogation at multiple precision levels, from fully defined chemical structures to broader chemical classes, is of great interest, e.g., for taxonomic and evolution studies.
This makes LOTUS a unique resource for the advancement of chemotaxonomy, a discipline pioneered by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and pursued by other notable researchers (Robert Hegnauer, Otto R. Gottlieb) [@doi:10.1007/978-3-642-68641-2; @doi:10/d592kt; @decandolleEssaiProprietesMedicales1816].
Six decades after Hegnauer's publication of "Die Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen" [@doi:10.1007/978-3-0348-9314-5] much remains to be done for the advancement of this field of study and the LOTUS initiative aims to provide a solid basis for researchers willing to pursue these exciting explorations at the interface of chemistry, biology and evolution.

As shown recently in the context of spectral annotation [@doi:10.1038/s41587-020-0740-8], lowering the precision level of the annotation allows a broader coverage along with greater confidence.
Genetic studies investigating the pathways involved and the organisms carrying the responsible biosynthetic genes would be of interest to confirm the previous observations.
These forms of data interpretation exemplify the importance of reporting not only new structures, but also novel occurrences of known structures in organisms as comprehensive chemotaxonomic studies are pivotal for a better understanding of the metabolomes of living organisms.

The integration of multiple knowledge sources, e.g. genetics for NP producing gene clusters [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz882] combined to taxonomies and occurrences DB, also opens new opportunities to understand if an organism is responsible for the *biosynthesis* of a NP or merely *contains* it.
This understanding is of utmost importance for the chemotaxonomic field and will help to understand to which extent microorganisms (endosymbionts) play a role in host development and its NP expression potential [@doi:10.1016/j.tplants.2004.04.005].
